  <div id="intro">
  <p><em>The Surf Spectrum doesn't care about your wave riding ability, but instead it reads your tendencies (both in and out of the water) and your overall surf authenticity. Whether you're a Florence Marine X stan or a potato chip charger on a 2 foot day, this test will tell you where you fall between Kook and Core Lord.</em></p>

<div id="instructions">
  For each question, click on the answer that fits you best.

  And be honest... we all know you don't rip <em>THAT</em> hard.
